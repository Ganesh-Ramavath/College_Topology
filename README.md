**Cisco AICTE Virtual Internship Program 2023**</br>
**Description:**</br>
This project was completed as part of the Cisco AICTE Virtual Internship Program in 2023. The main objective was to design a college network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer, a network simulation tool, to demonstrate practical networking skills and knowledge gained during the internship program.</br>
****
**Project Overview:**</br>
**Objective:** Design a functional college network topology that encompasses various networking devices, such as routers, switches, servers, and end devices.</br>
**Tools Used:** Cisco Packet Tracer, a powerful network simulation tool provided by Cisco Systems.</br>
**Components:** The network topology includes multiple VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, DHCP configuration, NAT configuration, security measures like access control lists (ACLs), and other relevant network configurations.</br>
**Topology Design:** The design adheres to best practices in network architecture and Cisco standards to ensure scalability, efficiency, and security.</br>
****
**Features:**</br>
**Multi-Layered Design:** The topology is structured in multiple layers, including core, distribution, and access layers, to optimize network traffic flow and scalability.</br>
**Redundancy:** Redundant links and devices are implemented to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.</br>
**Security Measures**: Access control lists (ACLs) and other security features are configured to protect the network from unauthorized access and potential threats.</br>
**Scalability**: The design is scalable to accommodate future growth and expansion of the college network infrastructure.</br></br>

**Instructions:**</br>
To simulate the college network topology:

Download and install Cisco Packet Tracer from the official Cisco website (link: Cisco Packet Tracer).
Open the provided Packet Tracer file named College_Network_Topology.pkt.
Start the simulation to observe the functionality of the network.
Explore various configurations and settings within Packet Tracer to understand the implementation details.</br>
